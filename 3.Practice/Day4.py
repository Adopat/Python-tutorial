Use a list comprehension to square each odd number in a list. 
The list is input by a sequence of comma-separated numbers. >Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
'''
# lst = [str(i**2) for i in list(map(int,input().split(','))) if i%2!=0]
# print(",".join(lst))
# print("=====Question17=====")

Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a transaction log from console input.
The transaction log format is shown as following:
'''
# total = 0
# while True:
#     s = input().split()
#     if not s:
#         break
#     cm,num = map(str,s)
#     if cm =="D":
#         total +=int(num)
#     if cm =="w":
#         total -=int(num)
# print(total)

A website requires the users to input username and password to register. 
Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
At least 1 letter between [a-z]
At least 1 number between [0-9]
At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
At least 1 character from [$#@]
Minimum length of transaction password: 6
Maximum length of transaction password: 12

You are required to write a program to sort the (name, age, score) tuples by ascending order 
where name is string, age and score are numbers. The tuples are input by console. The sort criteria is:
1: Sort based on name
2: Then sort based on age
3: Then sort by score

John,20,90
Jony,17,91
