print("=====Question31=====")
'''
Define a function which can print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys.
'''
# dict = {i:i**2 for i in range(1,21)}
# print(dict)
print("=====Question32=====")
'''
Define a function which can generate a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 20 (both included) and the values are square of keys. 
The function should just print the keys only.
'''
# dict = {i:i**2 for i in range(1,21)}
# print(dict.keys())
print("=====Question33=====")
'''
Define a function which can generate and print a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included).
'''
# lst = [i**2 for i in range(1,21)]
# print(lst)
print("=====Question34=====")
'''
Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the first 5 elements in the list.
'''
# lst = [i**2 for i in range(1,21)][:5]
# print(lst)
print("=====Question35=====")
'''
Define a function which can generate a list where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 20 (both included). Then the function needs to print the last 5 elements in the list.
'''
lst = [i ** 2 for i in range(1, 21)][-5:]
print(lst)
